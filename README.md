# Prompter

Prompter is a small web application that generates creative prompts for AI models. It runs entirely in the browser using HTML, TailwindCSS and vanilla JavaScript.

## Opening the application

Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser. You can double‑click the file or use your browser's **Open File** option. No server setup is required.

## Customization

### Theme
- **Dark theme** (default) and **Light theme** are available.
- Use the sun/moon buttons in the top‑left corner to switch themes. Your preference is saved locally.

### Language
- Prompter currently supports **English** (`EN`) and **Turkish** (`TR`).
- Use the language switcher in the top‑right corner to choose your interface language. The setting persists in your browser.

### Categories
Prompter offers several prompt categories: **Random Mix**, **Inspiring**, **Mind‑blowing**, **Productivity**, **Educational**, **Crazy**, **Perspective**, **AI**, **Ideas**, **Video**, **Image**, and **Hellprompts**.

The new **Video** option focuses on concepts for short films, documentaries, and other clips. The **Image** option helps you imagine visually striking scenes or designs.

To select a category, open `index.html` and look for the buttons under **Select Your Prompt Inspiration**. Click a category icon—such as the *Video* camera icon—to highlight it and then press **Generate New Prompt**.
