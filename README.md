# Prompter

Prompter is a small web application that generates creative prompts for AI models. It runs entirely in the browser using HTML, TailwindCSS and vanilla JavaScript.

## Opening the application

- Use the sun/moon buttons in the top‑left corner to switch themes. Your preference is saved locally.

### Language
- Prompter currently supports **English** (`EN`) and **Turkish** (`TR`).
- Use the language switcher in the top‑right corner to choose your interface language. The setting persists in your browser.
